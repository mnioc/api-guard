# api-guard - HTTP API Automation Testing Framework
guard is a powerful HTTP API automation testing framework designed to simplify and accelerate the API testing process. It can automatically discover test cases, support the generation of positive and negative test cases, and comes with multiple built-in HTTP authentication clients, making testing more flexible and efficient.

## Features of api-guard
- Automatic discovery of test cases: api-guard can automatically search and load unit tests and test suites in the specified directory, reducing the tedious configuration steps.

- Built-in HTTP authentication clients: Supports common HTTP authentication methods, including basic authentication, digest authentication, etc., to easily meet different authentication requirements.

- Automatic generation of positive test cases: api-guard can automatically generate positive test cases based on the API's input specification, reducing the workload of manually writing test cases.

- Automatic generation of negative test cases: In addition to positive test cases, api-guard also has the ability to automatically generate negative test cases, helping you comprehensively cover various scenarios of the API.

- Support for multiple types of testing: api-guard supports multiple types of test suites, including unit tests, interface tests, performance tests, etc., to meet different testing requirements.

- Support for multiple types of test reports: api-guard supports multiple types of test reports, including HTML reports and Excel reports, to meet different reporting requirements.

- Support for declaring test cases in YAML: api-guard supports test cases in YAML format, allowing for concise test case definitions. This is a great choice for testers who are not familiar with programming.

- Support for pipeline-style execution: Test cases may require certain context environments. api-guard supports pipelined execution, providing complete context management for test cases.
